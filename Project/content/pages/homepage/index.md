Whether you are a new business, a small Sole Proprietor or the Manager of a company, 2019 is the year to make a definitive Plan Of Action that will propel you to reach your goals this year and beyond.

Yes! But when do you have the time to put a new Plan INTO Action? We will help you prioritize your Marketing To-Do list and can assist you in implementing your program if you do not have a staff or members on your team that can take on another project!

### We will begin with getting to know you and your business
We are dedicated to give your business our full attention. Weâ€™ll begin with a short consultation to go over the basics and what you need right now, within 6 months, one year, and beyond as time allows.
This meeting is usually 45-90 minutes. It can be as thorough or as modest as you like; We take the information you share into confidence, then puts together a detailed Plan Of Action for you. 

### Turning plans into Actions!
When we meet again, it is to go over a suggested Plan Of Action developed just for your business and the goals you have stated. You may decide to implement the entire plan or a portion of the plan. I am here to assist you at the rate you are ready to proceed. You are the Driver; I am more like the Navigator or GPS.

### Schedule with business helper by texting us or using the contact form.
We will begin as quickly and as strongly as you want to hit the road. You may determine that some of the Tasks and Actions are things you can do yourself or delegate to someone on your staff, giving your Business Helper and Partner more time to donate to the implementation of more complex and/or time consuming activities in the Plan. 

### Producing Results
Our Business Starup Helper wants you to see results! It is important to your peace of mind, your budget, and the future of your company to be 'in the know' and it is important to me to help you understand the results of our efforts. This reporting can be  simplified or summarized in an easy-to-understand format. 

We will determine together how often you want to receive reports during our Plan Of Action Meeting.
