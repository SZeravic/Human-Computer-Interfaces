# Coaching Works!
## Give up the struggle!
Imagine a relationship where the total focus is on you, on what you want in your life and work, and on what will help you achieve it.  The coaching relationship is like that.  It’s unique.  Coaching is like having your own personal navigator for the journey you are on; someone who will help you find your way as well as stay on course.

Imagine someone listening, not only to your words, but also to the tone, the nuances of your voice, your emotions and  your energy.  This is your coach; someone who wants to receive all that you want to communicate. He/ she listens without judgement and allow you to show emotion.  He/she will accept you without analyzing you.    In essence a coach will hear the very best in you, even when you can’t hear it in yourself.

Imagine someone who will hold you accountable to keep you moving forward toward your visions, dreams and goals.  Coaching helps individuals focus on specific outcomes and stay motivated and on track.

Imagine a relationship with a person who is sometimes even more committed to what you want in your life and work than you are!  A coach knows your values and life purpose and makes certain you pay attention to that every day.  Your relationship with your coach invites you to break free of self-limiting conversations that you may have had over the years.  In turn, the voices of defeat are simply noticed while the  powerful part of you becomes encouraged.  He/she is the person who holds the flag at the top of the hill, encouraging you to press on. A coach will celebrate your success and help you learn from your setbacks.   Your coach is the one you turn to when you are looking for the courage to take the  next risk in your life; one that you already know you are ready to take.

Imagine a relationship with someone who will absolutely tell you the truth.  A coach will tell you where you are great, as well as where you sell yourself short.  He/ she knows you can handle hearing the truth and will offer it in order to keep you moving towards what’s really important to you.  A well-trained coach  makes maximum use of listening and other communication skills to help you  live a full live and achieve extraordinary results at work.

Coaching is a partnership! The process is easy for clients, in fact a great deal of coaching takes place over the phone.  Regardless of whether you’ve just made a mess of things or have accomplished a great success, your coach is there for you every single week.   Many businesses are hiring coaches because they value the perspective of someone outside their company and appreciate receiving the honest and truthful advice untainted by corporate politics or hidden agendas.

In professional sports, athletes have coaches to keep them motivated,  on track, guide their progress, support their success, and improve upon any identifiable weaknesses.   Today, individuals, executives and managers, as well as business owners are hiring coaches to keep their winning edge. Most winning sports teams say they could not have been the best, without the support, strategic assistance, encouragement, insights, focus, accountability and, yes, the “push” they received from their coach. Individuals and businesses are now saying the same.
