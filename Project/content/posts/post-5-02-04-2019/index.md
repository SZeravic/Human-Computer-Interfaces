# The Importance of Good Credit
When an individual applies for credit, either personally or to guarantee a loan, the lending institution will evaluate that person’s credit history.  This is done by pulling a credit bureau report.  A credit report is a snapshot of your credit history and will determine if a lender will extend credit based on your past performance.  The credit reports also calculates a credit score using factors such as promptness in paying bills, total available credit, amount owed on loans and number of credit inquiries in the past 6 months.  These scores range from 500 to 800.  Anything over 700 is considered a good credit risk.

Lending Institutions or creditors will run a report from one or all three of the national reporting agencies ? Equifax, Experian (formerly TRW) and Trans Union.  You should always review your credit report for errors at least every 2 to 3 years and prior to any major purchase.  You can do this by obtaining your credit report through the national agencies at the following locations:

1. Equifax – 800-685-1111 - [www.equifax.com](https://www.equifax.com/personal/)
2. Experian – 888-397-3742 - [www.experian.com](https://www.experian.com/)
3. Trans Union – 800-888-4213 - [www.transunion.com](https://www.transunion.com/)

If you know you have had problems in the past obtaining credit begin rectifying it now by requesting a copy of your report, review it for errors and try to resolve any outstanding items.  Good credit will be one less thing to worry about when you go to purchase a home or car, plan for your child’s college education or apply for the job you always wanted.
