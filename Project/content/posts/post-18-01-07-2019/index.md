# Stationery
## Q: For our stationery we want to use raised printing like thermography. Is this processes laser compatible?
A: Although thermography is inexpensive, it is essentially a “plastic” ink that has been heated to give a raised effect. If your laser printer is hot enough, thermography will make a mess out of both stationery and printer. A better form of raised printing is Engravalith. You could also engrave your stationery, but this process is very expensive.
