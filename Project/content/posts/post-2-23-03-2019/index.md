Do you want your new business to be a place that people are proud to work?

Do you want your employees to enjoy coming to work every day because they feel like valued members of the company?

You should want this and more. Creating a positive startup culture is essential for the success of your business. This article will teach you 9 ways to have a positive startup culture.

### 1. Hire Carefully
Your employees are the people who will make the culture of your company.

You’ll want to take your time with hiring to ensure the people you choose will put your company in the right light.

In addition to the traditional interview process, it could be a good idea to give potential hires personality quizzes. This will allow you to see how their personality will mix with the values and culture of the company.

### 2. Define Core Values
In order to attract the right kind of people to your company, you need to define it’s core values.

Think about what the purpose of the company is and how it helps better your community and the world at large. Think about why you started the company in the first place.

Write down all the buzzwords that come to mind when you think about your company’s mission. Then, pick the 5 that are most important to you and dub them your “core values.”

Be sure to post your core values on all your job descriptions so that people understand what the company stands for.

### 3. Listen to Employees
Once you find a staff that fits into your company culture it is essential that you do everything you can to keep them happy.

This includes listening to what they say and welcoming open discourse. You don’t want employees who talk behind your back or who are secretly bitter about the way things are run.

Instead, you want to create a culture where people aren’t afraid to speak up. Do this by actively encouraging employees to give their feedback.

If you feel like employees don’t want to speak up because they’re afraid, you can try opening an anonymous suggestion box at work. This way, employees can submit suggestions without fear of repercussions.

### 4. Give Your Employees Rewards
All great leaders know the importance of rewarding hard work.

Rewards incentivize employees to work harder and make them feel appreciated. Set goals for your employees and then reward them when they meet a goal.

Good goals could be getting to leave early on Friday, free lunch, or a team bonding activity.

### 5. Bond With Your Team
Speaking of team bonding, it is absolutely essential that you have positive relationships between your employees.

One way to do this is through team bonding activities.

Escape rooms are an excellent team bonding activity for corporate parties as they require that you work together. In an escape room, you and your team will have to work together to discover clues and ultimately “escape.”

Escape rooms let you see your employees in a different light outside of work. New talents and abilities might appear that you didn’t even know you had.

If an escape room isn’t for you, even something as simple as playing board games together or going out to dinner can enhance your team’s bonds.

### 6. Give Your Employees Feedback
Your employees work hard and they deserve to know how they’re doing along the way.

Be sure to take time out of your schedule to do performance reviews with your employees. Be open and honest with them if there are areas you want them to improve in.

During your performance review you can also check in with them and ask what you could do to make the job easier on them.

### 7. Caffeinate Your Office
Caffeine is the life force of the office. Make sure your employees are being properly fueled by supplying a coffee and espresso machine.

This might seem like a small gesture, but it’s a gesture that keeps on giving. Your employees will be able to enjoy the coffee you provide on their breaks and this will motivate them to work harder.

### 8. Celebrate Birthdays and Holidays
Let’s face it, work is typically the last place your employees want to be on their birthday or on a holiday.

Make it fun for them by having a miniature work party. Holding parties for people’s birthdays makes them feel welcome and that they’re part of the group.

Be sure to have everyone else in the office sign a birthday card for them. A major component of a strong company culture is ensuring that everyone feels included.

Be sure to celebrate all religious holidays so that you’re covering all your employees.

### 9. Lead by Example
If you want to create a strong company culture, you yourself must eat sleep and breath said culture.

You need to lead by example by ensuring that you embody the values outlined in your core values.

You need to make sure you’re friendly, communicative, and on time every single day. You shouldn’t expect behavior from your employees that you can’t even do yourself.

If you’re a strong leader, your employees will follow your example and respect you for your work ethic.
