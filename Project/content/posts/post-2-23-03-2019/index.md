# Your Logo Should Change as Your Business Changes
Your logo should change as your business changes throughout time. As change happens, update, refresh and redesign your logo. If you look at a brand’s history, you will notice subtle changes throughout the years, especially for major brands like Coca-Cola, Pepsi, IBM, Lego, etc. There are many reasons to update and redesign a logo including refreshing the look to be more current and no longer outdated, change in direction or [mission](https://topnonprofits.com/examples/nonprofit-mission-statements/), merging with another company, etc.

Back in 1999, we decided that our mission and tagline was “On-the-mark solutions for small business.” For the logo, I chose a pen and target to symbolize hitting this mark. The pen is an integral part of any business and has symbolized much throughout history. [The pen is mightier than the sword](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=the+pen+is+mightier+than+the+sword) and stands for learning, intelligence, thinking, creativity, change and much more.

What hasn’t changed is the name and the mission, “Helping Your Business Succeed.” How we are going to be helping your business succeed is going to be much different. The big change in the logo is the target and pen which is no more.
