# Press Releases
## An inexpensive way to promote your business.
Just recently, I was featured on Fox 5 Good Morning NY early edition.  The topic was “How A Small Business Owner Can Promote their Web Site”.  After 2 hours worth of tape I was surprise to see my 15 minutes of fame down to 2 minutes worth of TV time.

But in those 2 hours of video tape,  I discussed some inexpensive ways a small business owner could promote their web site.  Some examples included;

1. Making sure your web site address is on all your business stationery.
2. Changing your phone message to reflect your web site address, such as “for more information visit our web site”.
3. Sending out a post card to all your customers, clients, business associates etc.  informing  them of your new site or updated site.

After taping the show, I went back to my office and proceed to contact all my clients, business associates, friends etc. on the upcoming air date and topic.

In order to capture the essence of the show, I typed up a one page press release and sent it to everyone, potential clients, existing clients, business associates, friends and family.

That one page press release helped to reaffirm my business with existing clients. Offer more insight to my potential clients and in the end landed (2) new accounts!

So the next time your company has something new and exciting to say, send out a Press Release.  It’s a great way to building your press kits, keeping your existing clients aware of events/news regarding your business and generating potential new business.
