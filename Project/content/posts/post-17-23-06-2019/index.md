# Marketing Your Company
Marketing your business is an important aspect of insuring your company’s longevity. Whether  you set a side a monthly budget or have no budget, simple yet consistent marketing is necessary.  Listed below are some suggestions:

1. Carry Business cards at all times (you never know when or where a client will come)
2. Ask clients why they hired your company and solicit suggestions for improvement
3. Develop a brochure of your services or products
4. Send hand written Thank You notes
5. Join a Business network such as the Chamber of Commerce, Toast Masters etc.
• Never let a day pass without doing at least one thing to promote your company
