# Building a Database, a Case Study
Follow along as I help Donna Long from Nebraska build a FileMaker Pro database system to run her small organic farm operation. I thought this project would be a great case study on what’s involved in developing software using FileMaker Pro.

I plan to provide guidance and help Donna get started building her database. Together we are going to follow the steps necessary to build a database system. The case study, [Getting Down and Dirty – Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/), is published on my Everything FileMaker site, [FMPRO Database](https://www.reddit.com/) under Case Studies.
